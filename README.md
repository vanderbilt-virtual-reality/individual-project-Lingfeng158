# PainSim
A Pain Simulator in VR inspired by Prometheus' Legend

## Purpose
This project is created to fulfill the individual project requirement for Vanderbilt VR Class.  

## Note for Playing the Game
The player is set to respawn in a valley where huge stone balls roll down once in a while. The balls cannot kill the player but will faint the player for a while. The player has to experience the horror and pain every time the player wakes up, and the whole scenario repeats again.

Behind the player are two short lances. No matter what, the player will invariably be hit by the ball, but he or she can use those lances to fight and delay the fate.

## Inspiration
The project draws inspiration from the legend of Prometheus, in which the immortal giant is chained to a rock and suffers from eagle attacks every day.  

Life is not always satisfactory, yet people have to burden the pains and difficulties and keep on with life. The falling stone balls symbolize the pains and torments in life. No matter how people try, bad things come and go, either from health, career, or family. The two short lances symbolize the will to fight and live on life. The vicissitude of life is the same for everyone, but strong people get stronger by fighting the pains and difficulties.

## Why VR
The game is created in Virtual Reality. While with skillful creating of artistic environment and atmospheric ambient sounds and music, game makers can achieve great horror and convey their meanings in games, the level of immersion in VR is unbeatable, especially in the genre of horror games.

By using VR, even though the game is created with low-resolution and low-poly assets and poor techniques, the game can still convey the meaning and intention of the game creator.
